# The Basics

## Functions
The syntax for functions is identical. You might be familiar with such great WordPress functions like:
* `the_title()`
* `the_content()`
* `get_header()`

Functions run other code, so you are not repeating or copy & pasting code nearly as much.

| PHP   |      JavaScript      |

| ```some_function()``` |  ```some_function()``` |
